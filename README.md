## Description

I developed a profile page to showcase my development work and a way for employers or others in the community to be able to contact me. I wanted a way that was more user friendly for non-developers to see my work than just having a github page. It gives an additional way to display my work while still having a link to my repository on github.

I learned skills in building and style a webpage using HTML and CSS.
