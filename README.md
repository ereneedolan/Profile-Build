## Description

I developed a profile page to showcase my development work and a way for employers and others in the community to be able to contact me. 

I wanted a way that was more user friendly for non-developers to see my work than just having a github page. 

The webpage gives an additional way to display my work with links to my deployed website projects in Project 1 and Project 3 while still having a link to my repository on github.

I learned skills in building and styling a webpage using HTML and CSS. Important features executed included href URLs and img src's wrapped in <a> tags to use images to lead to external site and working on responsive CSS.
